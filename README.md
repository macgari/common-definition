## Common Definitions ETL Utility 


### Overview

This pipeline gathers medical concepts, vocabularies, and terminologies from multiple sources. The main sources is UMLS and other sources (NCI. OHDSI, MSK ONCOTREE) are imported as crosswalks to UMLS.
UMLS provides data in the form of binary (files.nlm) files along with a tool called Metamorphysis which extracts and filters subsets of data into Pipe-Separated-Value files of (Rich Release Format aka rrf) extention (files.rrf). MetaMorphysis also provides sql scripts to help uploading RRFs to a MySQL server instance.
The typical etl cycle for umls is: umls.nlm -> umls-subset.rrf -> MySQL UMLS database.
The typical etl cycle for nci is: nci.rrf -> MySQL NCI database.
Notice the difference; UMLS provides sources as .nlm while NCI provides sources as .rrf.
Due to limitation in design of MetaMorphysis tool, it only accepts (.nlm) files as a source, therefore subsetting is not accomplished during load, however it could be accomplished when querying the nci database i.e;  
```select * from mrconso where sab in ('fda','snomed','loinc'); ``` 


### Sources 
 - NIH   -- Must Read    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9676/
   - umls
   - nci
 - ohsdi -- Must Read    https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/
 - evn   -- Must Explore https://evn.mskcc.org/evn/tbl/swp?_viewName=home

### Prerequisites
 
 - Nearly 300 GB of storage
 - MySQL server instance, with root access privilege 
   - username and password would need to be updated in nih.sql.sh, ohdsi.sh, and trans.sh scripts

### Scripts

 - umls.nlm.sh -- Downloads and Extracts umls concepts from web
   - umls.download.sh 
   - nih.sql.sh

 - nci.rrf.sh -- Downloads and Extracts nci concepts from web 
   - nci.download.sh				
   - nih.sql.sh

 - ohdsi.sh -- Extracts ohdsi concepts from a manually downloaded archive

 - evn.sh  -- Downloads and Extracts umls concepts from mskcc intranet
   - evn.download.sh

 - trans.sh -- aggregates and transforms concepts from all sources 

 - load.sh -- Ships concepts and their attributes to cvs repository on SOLR


### Running the pipeline

- Components can be run individually or as a group in parallel
- cdi.sh runs all components in parallel, but prameters need to be loaded into cdi.sh
- Individual components can be run, with arguments, as follows
  - sh umls.nlm.sh nih_username nih_password "https://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/2018AA/umls-2018AA-full.zip" mysql_username mysql_password mysql_host mysql_port
  - sh nci.rrf.sh nih_username nih_password mysql_username mysql_password mysql_host mysql_port
  - sh ohdsi.sh mysql_username mysql_password mysql_host mysql_port "/path/to/ohdsi/archive.zip"
  - sh evn.sh evn_username evn_password mysql_username mysql_password mysql_host mysql_port
  - sh trans.sh mysql_username mysql_password mysql_host mysql_port trans
  - sh load.sh trans/trans.json
- Two manual tables are needed for the pipeline to run. 
  
  - The first table is called ohdsi_to_umls and is loaded in a database called cdi. cdi database should be created if not already created. In the cdi.sh script, under "TEMPORARY SOLUTION", the script execute a sql file called cdi_ohdsi_to_umls.sql to create abd populate the database and its tabke. When moving to production this step should be ignored.
  
  - The second table is called oncotree and is created in the evn database. In the cdi.sh script, under "TEMPORARY SOLUTION", the script executes a sql file called evn_oncotree.sql which creates and populates the table with data. Onctree table is created until we figure out the correct sources and mapping from MSK evn.   

### Notes on Configuration

 Some configurations have dependencies on the environment in which the pipeline is running
  - $MYSQL_HOME needs to be setup correctly in _.profile_, _.bashrc_, _.bash_profile_, etc i.e export MYSQL_HOME=/path/to/mysql/command
  - NIH Account is needed, the same account will be used to pull UMLS and NCI data
  - Depending on the OS, the carriage return needs to be updated for this parameter OSX_SED="s/\\\r\\\n/\\\n/g" in umls.nlm.sh and nci.rrf.sh

#### _CURLing with SSL_


1) For Mac, this script requires curl with openssl. See the following commands for updating curl with openssl using homebrew (valid as of 11/24/2017):
		> /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
		> brew install --with-openssl curl
		> brew link curl â€“force



2) Run nih.download.sh with the appropriate nih_username, nih_password and download file URL: (Replace the RxNorm URL example with URL of the file you wish to download.)
		> sh umls.download.sh nih_username nih_password https://download.nlm.nih.gov/umls/kss/rxnorm/RxNorm_full_current.zip
